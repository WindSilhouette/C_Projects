Part 1: csel-kh1250-06  April 13th

	Explain your results (2-3 sentences): 
	The correlation between the 0s and 1s in known_secret is that 1s represent a cache hit and the
	0s represent a cache miss causing the timing to be longer in the 0s than the 1s. The 1s threshold is 
	150. So if the delta value is above or below that it will result into the corresponding 0 or 1.

	Calculated threshold: 150

	Secret Array: {0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1}


Part 3:

	Computer 1: csel-kh1262-01.cselabs.umn.edu
	Calculated threshold: 500
	Secret Array: {0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1}
	Comment: Very inconsistant. When ran, it was about a 50% rate of hitting the desired secret array

	Computer 2: csel-wb28-01.cselabs.umn.edu
	Calculated threshold: 150
	Secret Array: {0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1}
	Comment: A bit more consistant than the other machines, the first cache hit was giving us a 1 
	instead of a zero


	CSE Server: csel-kh1262-02.cselabs.umn.edu
	Calculated threshold: 150
	Secret Array: {0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1}
	Comment: Very consistant and fast low amount of errors in timings (had to use keller twice becuase
	ssh would time out in any other building except keller and walter)


	VOLE: 
	Calculated threshold: 1450
	Secret Array: {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1}
	Comment: Vole seems to have a really high threshold I assume becuase of the amount of people
	one VOLE at once causing the timings to be longer, I also noticed that the first 1 in the secret
	always took really long, in this case it was somewhere inbetween 6000-12000


	Why were the times different/similar?
	Timing for the most part were very differnt except for keller 262 computer 02 and walter b28 computer 01. We think this is because the amount of people remotely
	connecting to the machines causes the differences in timings, explaining why VOLE was the most being the most popular virtual machine. All around
	this project was very interesting to see the differences between the timing of cache hits and misses and depending on the computer hardware,
	how fast the data is accessed and hardware used.
